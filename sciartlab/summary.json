	"description" : "We are a Research and Development Lab for the open exploration of Science, Art and Technology. We foster multidisciplinary knowledge and technology-driven creativity, essential cognitive tools for the coming P2P Society. We create open source prototypes and contribute to the emergence of the distributed metaverse, exploring new ways to visualize, analyze and interact with information. We follow unconventional research approaches to hack seemingly unrelated topics such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence, ethnography, music, biology, photography, chemistry or digital art.",
